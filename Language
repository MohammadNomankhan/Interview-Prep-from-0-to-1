#1 Choosing language between Java, C++ and python.
    I know C, so I watched c++ playlist by Luv at 2X speed on YouTube. 
    Now I am following Kunal Kushwaha's Java playlist as concept remain same and where ever its different like STL in C++ (for java collection framework) I will adjust.
    
#2 DSA 
    I will watch videos from Applied Coding Track itself and if concept is not clearly explained I will move on to ZTM by Andreie Neagoie.
